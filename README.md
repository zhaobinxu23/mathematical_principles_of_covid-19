The input data are provided in supplementary materials in the paper with the name "metadata.xlsx" and "sequence_ncbi.fasta".

run codeforfigure1a.m  to anaylze the metadata.xlsx to plot figure1a; // you have to load 'metadata.xlsx' first
run codeforfigure1b.m  to anaylze the metadata.xlsx to plot figure1b; // you have to load 'metadata.xlsx' first

run code_pairwisescorematrix_table1.m to generate the pair-wise score matrix in table1, with the input as sequence_ncbi.fasta file;

The pair-wise sequence silimarity score matrix is marked as matrix_29782_29782;matrix_29782_29903;matrix_29903_29903;
